# Web VR Demo made with Three.js (WebXR), Node.js(Express) and TypeScript

For this Project I used the Boilerplate made by Sean Bradleys for his Udemy Course: 
* [ThreeJS and TypeScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/threejs-tutorials/?referralCode=4C7E1DE91C3E42F69D0F)


# WebXR

WebXR allows us to use VR in a Browser and you can switch between the normal 3D scene and the VR Scene. Through the Three.js Library this is quite simple and with some Tutorials, Blogs and the Three.js Documentation i made this little Demo

This is how the Scene looks alike. Through the press of the Button on the bottom you can switch to VR mode
