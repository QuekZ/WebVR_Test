# Web VR Demo made with Three.js (WebXR), Node.js(Express) and TypeScript

For this Project I used the Boilerplate made by Sean Bradleys for his Udemy Course: 
* [ThreeJS and TypeScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/threejs-tutorials/?referralCode=4C7E1DE91C3E42F69D0F)


# WebXR

WebXR allows us to use VR in a Browser and you can switch between the normal 3D scene and the VR Scene. Through the Three.js Library this is quite simple and with some Tutorials, Blogs and the Three.js Documentation i made this little Demo

This is how the Scene looks alike. Through the press of the Button on the bottom you can switch to VR mode

After the pressing the Button you will get this:

You can also use  cylinders as your controlers. You could use all kinds of geometries or you could also load a 3D file with the GLTF Loader
here is a screenshot of the controlers:

I wanted to test my little Project but unfortunately i dont own a VR Headset. Thereforei found an emulator for the Browser in which i can move and rotate the Controllers and the Headset. Its quite clunky obviously but it does its job!
